        <ul>
            <li>Licorice root has been used for thousands of years as a herbal treatment. It was prized for its medical properties among the ancient Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians, particularly for treating digestive issues. It was intended to go with King Tutankhamun into the afterlife as it was so valuable in Egypt.</li>
            <li>Glycyrrhizin, found in licorice root, has a sweetness that can surpass that of sucrose (table sugar) by up to 50 times. Its inherent sweetness makes it a popular addition to candies and other sweet delicacies, but it may also be used to enhance the flavor of herbal drinks and natural cures without the need for added sugar.</li>
            <li>The licorice plant, Glycyrrhiza glabra, is indigenous to regions of Asia and Europe. However, because of its widespread use and popularity, it is now grown all over the world, including in some parts of the United States. It is a legume that grows well in these warm regions and is related to beans and peas.</li>

    <section class="licorice-history">
        <h1 id="section-header">Our History</h1>
        <p id="section-content">The manufacturer of Twizzlers candy is one of the oldest confectionery firms in the United States. The company was established in 1845 as Young and Smylie, and adopted Y&S as its trademark in 1870.
            National Licorice Company was created in 1902 through the merger of three small firms: Young & Smylie, S.V. & F.P. Schudder and H.W. Petherbridge. In 1908 a plant was opened in Montreal and in 1929 the Twizzlers brand was created. 
            The company changed its name to Y&S Candies Inc. in 1968. Y&S Candies was acquired by Hershey Foods Corporation in November 1977 in a pooling-of-interests, then merged into Hershey in January 1982.
            Since 1999, Twizzlers have been manufactured in Memphis, Tennessee, as well as Lancaster, in a Y&S plant that makes chewing gum and other candies. From 1970 through 1999, it was manufactured in Farmington, New Mexico, but relocated the operation to Memphis due to rising transportation costs. 
            According to the Guinness Book of Records, the longest licorice twist ever made measured 1,200 feet (370 m) and 100 pounds (45 kg) and was made at the Y&S Candy Plant in Lancaster, Pennsylvania in 1998.</p>
